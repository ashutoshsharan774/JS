<!-- In JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects. It allows scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of HTML documents.

Here's a brief overview of how the DOM works:

Document Object: The document object represents the entire HTML document. It provides methods and properties for accessing and manipulating elements within the document.

Element Objects: HTML elements on the page are represented as element objects in the DOM tree. You can access these elements using methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, or more modern methods like querySelector and querySelectorAll.

Node Objects: In addition to elements, the DOM tree also consists of other types of nodes such as text nodes, comment nodes, etc.

Manipulation: You can dynamically manipulate the content and attributes of elements using JavaScript. This includes adding, removing, or modifying elements and their attributes.

Event Handling: JavaScript allows you to attach event handlers to elements, such as onclick, onmouseover, etc., to respond to user interactions with the webpage.*/ -->

<!-- Difference between queryselector and query selectorall
In summary, querySelector returns only the first matching element, while querySelectorAll returns a NodeList containing all match -->



<!--style in javascript is used to access and modify css styles of html element dynamically-->
<!-- // Accessing the style property of an element
const element = document.getElementById('myElement');

// Modifying the style
element.style.color = 'red';
element.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
 -->

 <!--to convert any other container in array we use 
Array.from(Nodelist)-->
