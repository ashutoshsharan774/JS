 <!--*****AJAX*******
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development to create asynchronous web applications. It allows you to make HTTP requests to the server 
from a web page without having to reload the entire page. With Ajax, you can update parts of a web page dynamically, handle user interactions,
 and fetch data from a server asynchronously, providing a smoother and more responsive user experience.
Basically ajax is an approach through which we can use diff technologies  together like html ,css, js,dom,xml,xslt, and most importantly xmlHttpRequest object
Making Requests:
In JavaScript, you can use the XMLHttpRequest object or the fetch() function (modern approach) to make HTTP requests to the server.
You specify the URL of the server endpoint you want to communicate with and optionally provide request parameters such as HTTP method, headers, and request body (for POST requests).

Handling Responses:
Once the server processes the request, it sends back a response containing data or other information.
In JavaScript, you define a callback function to handle the response when it is received. This callback function is executed asynchronously when the response arrives.
You can then update the web page dynamically with the data received from the server without requiring a full page reload.

Updating the DOM:
After receiving the response from the server, you can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page using JavaScript to update specific elements or display the fetched data.
This allows you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and display real-time data from the server.

it returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in, Following are the probable states a client can be in
Value	State	            Description
0	    UNSENT	             Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	    OPENED	             open() has been called.
2	    HEADERS_RECEIVED	  send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	    LOADING	Downloading;  responseText holds partial data.
4	    DONE	               The operation is complete.

<!--When using XHR, you can set the responseType property to specify how the response data should be treated. Common values for responseType include:
"" (empty string) or "text": Treat the response as plain text.
"json": Parse the response as JSON automatically.
"arraybuffer": Treat the response as an ArrayBuffer.
"blob": Treat the response as a Blob.-->
